# WarhammerFantasyCalculator
For use with Warhammer Fantasy Battles 8th edition

This calculator is used to determine the outcome of an equal points matchup between two units.
One unit is selected as the unit that charges, the other will be the unit that holds.

The two units then face off in simulated combat until either unit either is wiped out or flees.

Currently this calculator only supports infantry, and does not take into account standing and shooting, only combat.

This calculator contains all army special rules and BRB special rules that could apply to the units.

Jar file compatable with Java 8.
